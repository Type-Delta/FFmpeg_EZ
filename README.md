# FFmpeg EZ
A graphical user interface for FFmpeg, a powerful multimedia processing tool.

The goal of this project is to make FFmpeg more accessible to users who are not familiar with its commands.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> FFmpeg EZ is currently in development and is not yet ready for use. (it has too many bugs)
> This is an old project from my first year of college, though I'm planning to rewrite it from scratch in the future.
